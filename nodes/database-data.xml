  Revision 1.72  2011/06/21 23:27:06  anoop
  Store only kickstartrootpassword in site.attrs
  Remove KickstartRootPassword when moving site.attrs
  to local disk

  Revision 1.71  2011/06/10 19:30:28  anoop
  -All grants now moved to rocks-db-perms.py
  -Changed ordering so that database-security
   is setup before any database accesses
  -Bug fixes

  Revision 1.70  2011/05/26 23:19:35  phil
  use unambiguous add host command.

  Revision 1.69  2011/05/12 18:19:21  anoop
  dbhost set for all clients except devel-servers.
  Needs to be made more generic to support all
  database installs.

  Database Security now set programmatically.
  All users have "SELECT" access on some tables
  apache has few more privs on some tables
  Root has all access to all.

  All passwords are random.

  Revision 1.68  2010/09/20 20:22:50  bruno
  use the 'primary_net' attribute to dictate which interface should be used
  as the 'primary'. we'll get the domain name from the subnets table and we'll
  set the hostname accordingly.

  Revision 1.67  2010/09/07 23:52:46  bruno
  star power for gb

  Revision 1.66  2010/08/02 20:35:44  bruno
  make sure the password attributes have their values placed in the 'shadow'
  column.

  Revision 1.65  2010/07/09 23:19:58  bruno

  CDATA the changelog field

  Revision 1.61  2010/06/30 17:37:32  anoop
  Overhaul of the naming system. We now support
  1. Multiple zone/domains
  2. Serving DNS for multiple domains
  3. No FQDN support for network names
     - FQDN must be split into name and domain.
     - Each piece information will go to a
       different table
  Hopefully, I've covered the basics, and not broken
  anything major

  Revision 1.60  2010/06/07 20:32:42  bruno
  the ipmi appliance is dead

  Revision 1.59  2010/05/20 20:59:10  bruno
  pulled my head of out of my keister and figured out how to pass parameters
  to 'rocks config host interface'

  Revision 1.58  2010/05/20 00:31:44  bruno
  gonna get some serious 'star power' off this commit.

  put in code to dynamically configure the static-routes file based on
  networks (no longer the hardcoded 'eth0').

  Revision 1.57  2010/03/25 00:30:39  bruno
  the start of the login appliance

  Revision 1.56  2010/03/04 19:32:48  mjk
  multicast is now just a class c (comments said so, but code did not)

  lower 255 multicast address are not supposed to route so this is a good
  choice as the default for the private network.  Other addresses can route
  so we leave this unconfigured.

  viz roll will need to add a route for cglx

  Revision 1.55  2009/12/02 21:30:28  mjk
  - Added ssh_use_dns attribute

  Revision 1.54  2009/08/28 21:00:33  bruno
  open the netmask up for multicast traffic

  Revision 1.53  2009/06/11 02:40:39  anoop
  - frontend "os" attribute missing. This can cause problems
  - fixed graph generation

  Revision 1.52  2009/06/05 19:57:16  bruno
  fix another 'interpreter' flag

  Revision 1.51  2009/05/20 23:50:38  anoop
  Re-Lockdown database access. But this time allow apache
  to access. Slightly better approach than my preceding
  boneheaded knee-jerk reaction.

  Revision 1.50  2009/05/20 23:32:44  anoop
  Too much lockdown can be a bad thing. If apache can't read my.cnf
  then kickstart files won't get generated.

  Revision 1.49  2009/05/20 09:20:12  mjk
  lock down perms

  Revision 1.48  2009/05/19 21:57:17  anoop
  Use the "interpreter" attribute instead of arg="--interpreter"

  Revision 1.47  2009/05/19 20:09:26  bruno
  only need to indicate 'interpreter' once

  Revision 1.46  2009/05/16 02:10:50  anoop
  Moved from RedHat MySQL to Rocks foundation-mysql
  rather forcefully.

  Turned off RedHat MySQL and cleanup of node xml files
  to remove all access to RedHat MySQL.

  Wordpress data and generic php mysql accesses are now
  directed to foundation-mysql. Here's hoping we got all
  of it.

  More files to follow

  Revision 1.40  2009/03/28 01:28:10  anoop
  Change the way managed_only flag is determined.

  - rsh edge is conditional (no more uncomment crap)
  - add global_attribute commands (list, set, remove, dump)
  - attributes are XML entities for kpp pass (both pass1 and pass2)

  Revision 1.17  2007/05/30 23:32:13  anoop
  The adding of compute nodes and NAS appliance information is moved
  from the hpc roll to the base roll. This seems to be a little more
  appropriate.

  Revision 1.16  2007/05/30 23:27:16  anoop
  Moved the security information that apache uses to log into mysql to the
  database.xml file.
  Schema changed slightly to clean column names

  Main changes are the use of command line tools to manipulate the database
  rather than using sql syntax directly. Still in beta stage.

  Revision 1.6  2004/05/28 23:25:23  bruno
  put the clusterold initialization after we write the new database

  Revision 1.5  2004/04/26 20:27:56  fds
  Safer Mysql. As Eric D Christensen pointed out, it is easy for users to
  accidentally disrupt the system by altering the database. We protect from
  outside menaces, but allow read-write access to anyone from localhost.

  This protects read-write access with SSL and passwords, like our wiki. It
  is not close to being secure, since the -uapache is an option, but it
  1) Prevents accidental changes from users via the web-interface, and
  2) Allows admins to access the database safely over the wide-area.

  I have also made a read-only access link, which is accessible for all users
  but does not allow modification. In addition, users from localhost can
  get read-only access from the command line without specifying -uapache. This
  is intended to protect against casual mistakes only.

  Left to the next release: a secure and easy way for kcgi to access the
  database as user apache.

  Revision 1.4  2004/04/14 02:50:33  bruno
