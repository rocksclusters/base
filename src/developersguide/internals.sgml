	<title> Roll Internals </title>

<para>
This section describes in detail the two major components of a roll: packages
and configuration files.
</para>


<section id="internals-roll-env" xreflabel="internals-roll-env">
        <title> Roll Development Environment </title>

<para>
In this section, we'll build an example roll (the Valgrind Roll) from the
ground up.
</para>

<para>
First, we need to create a development environment that can be used to build
the Valgrind Roll.
On a Rocks frontend, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# mkdir -p /export/src/roll
# cd /export/src/roll
# rocks create new roll name=valgrind
</screen>

<para>
There are several more options you can supply to
<constant>"rocks create new roll"</constant> (execute
<constant>"rocks create new roll help"</constant> to see all the options).
</para>

<para>
The command <constant>"rocks create new roll name=valgrind"</constant>
creates the following file system:
</para>

<screen>

&boxur;&boxh;&boxh; valgrind
    &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; graphs
    &boxv;   &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; default
    &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; nodes
    &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; src
        &boxvr&boxh;&boxh; usersguide
        &boxv;   &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; images
        &boxur&boxh;&boxh; valgrind
            &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; Makefile
            &boxur;&boxh;&boxh; test-1.0.tgz
            &boxvr;&boxh;&boxh; version.mk

</screen>

<note>
<para>
At this point, the roll is "buildable". It doesn't actually do much, but
the structure is functional. Type <constant>make roll</constant> to build the roll.  When the build completes, a
<constant>valgrind-1.0-0.&lt;arch&gt;.disk1.iso</constant> file should be in the build directory. This is the complete roll image.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Now we are ready to add packages to the Valgrind Roll.
</para>


</section>


<section id="internals-packages" xreflabel="internals-packages">
        <title>Packages</title>

<para>
A Rocks roll requires that all packages contained in the roll must be in the
native format of the OS.
For Redhat-based Rocks clusters, this means all packages must be RPMS.
</para>

<para>
This guide covers a few ways to deal with RPMs. Already built, hand-built in a directory, and compiled RPMs.   The last (compiled RPMs) is by far the most 
common.  
</para>

<section id="internals-packages-rpm" xreflabel="internals-packages-rpm">
        <title>The Software is Already in an RPM </title>

<para>
If the software you wish to install is already in RPM format, you can directly
put it into the roll source tree.
For example, to put the RPM <constant>unzip-5.52-3.el5.x86_64.rpm</constant>
into the Valgrind Roll, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# mkdir -p /export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64
# cp /tmp/unzip-5.52-3.el5.x86_64.rpm /export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64
</screen>

</section>


<section id="internals-packages-bundle" xreflabel="internals-packages-bundle">
        <title>Bundle an Existing Subdirectory into an RPM </title>

<para>
If your application is already installed on your frontend and you would like
to bundle its subdirectory into and RPM, you can
create an RPM that contains all the files in a subdirectory.
For example, let's say you want to create an RPM from all the files under
/opt/stream.
You can execute:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks create package /opt/stream stream
</screen>

<para>
This will create a package named <constant>stream-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm</constant>
in the current working directory.
To see the contents of the package, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# rpm -qlp stream-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm 
/
/opt
/opt/stream
/opt/stream/bin
/opt/stream/bin/stream
/opt/stream/bin/stream_f

/opt/stream/docs/stream.c
/opt/stream/docs/stream.f
/opt/stream/docs/sunos.mk
/opt/stream/docs/version.mk
</screen>

<para>
There are several more options you can supply to
<constant>"rocks create package"</constant> (execute
<constant>"rocks create package help"</constant> to see all the options).
</para>

<para>
Now place the RPM into the correct directory within the roll:
</para>

<screen>
# mkdir -p /export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64
# cp stream-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm /export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64
</screen>


</section>


<section id="internals-packages-src"
	xreflabel="Create an RPM from a Source Code Tarball">
        <title>Create an RPM from a Source Code Tarball (Compiled RPM)</title>

<para>
The most common way we create RPMS is from source tarballs (the classic:
untar, ./configure, make, make install). Rocks has a set of Makefile includes
that greatly simplifies the creation of RPMs. Most software can be packaged as
an RPM without ever seeing the internals of the package format. 
</para>

<para>
First, we'll download the source tarball into the correct directory:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/src/roll/valgrind/src/valgrind
# wget http://valgrind.org/downloads/valgrind-3.6.0.tar.bz2
</screen>

<para>
Edit <constant>version.mk</constant> and change
<constant>NAME = test</constant> to
<constant>NAME = valgrind</constant>, change
<constant>TARBALL_POSTFIX = tgz</constant> to
<constant>TARBALL_POSTFIX = tar.bz2</constant>, change
<constant>PKGROOT = /opt/valgrind</constant> to
<constant>PKGROOT = /opt</constant>,and change
<constant>VERSION = 1.0</constant> to
<constant>VERSION = 3.6.0</constant>.
Your version.mk should look like:
</para>

<screen>
PKGROOT		= /opt
NAME    	= valgrind
VERSION 	= 3.6.0
RELEASE 	= 1
TARBALL_POSTFIX	= tar.bz2
</screen>

<para>
Edit <constant>Makefile</constant> and change the line:
<constant>gunzip -c</constant> to
<constant>bzcat</constant> (since the tarball is a bz2).
</para>

<para>
Now build the RPM:
</para>

<screen>
# make rpm
</screen>

<para>
It will take several minutes to build the package.
When it completes, you'll see the line:
</para>

<screen>
Wrote: /export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64/valgrind-3.6.0-1.x86_64.rpm
</screen>

<para>
You can inspect the contents of the <constant>valgrind</constant> RPM:
</para>

<screen>
# rpm -qlp /export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64/valgrind-3.6.0-1.x86_64.rpm

<para>
Note that the valgrind-3.6.0-1.x86_64.rpm RPM was automatically placed into
the correct directory (/export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64).
</para>

<note>
<para>
If you want to pass different <constant>configure</constant> options to for
your build, edit your <constant>Makefile</constant>.
</para>
</note>

</section>
<section id="internals-rpm-make-process" xreflabel="internals-rpm-make-process">
        <title>The RPM Makefile Process</title>
<para>
The Rocks Makefile include structure is invoked from the sample Makefile in the lines.
<screen>
-include $(ROCKSROOT)/etc/Rules.mk
include Rules.mk
</screen>
</para>
<para>
The main purpose of this structure is to create the correct files so that the 
<constant>rpmbuild</constant> can work properly. The core of Rocks builds more
than 300 different packages, and our goal was to eliminate the creation
of custom RPM spec files. Spec files are the text files that drive the overall
package creation. 
</para>

<para>
Let's look at the other directories created on demand when you type 
<constant>make rpm</constant>. The roll directory structure now looks like before:

        <title>How the SPEC file does it's building/installing</title>

<para> Ultimately, the program <constant>rpmbuild</constant> must be called
to do its work.  The generated spec file (valgrind.spec) is used to drive the
rpmbuild process.   RPM spec files can be very complicated, Rocks takes a very
simple approach, essentially ignorning many of the advanced capabilities of 
RPM specification.
</para>
<para>
What follows here is an abbreviated spec file.  It's beyond this guide to
describe in detail options in a spec file. A number of web resources are

<section id="internals-xml-files" xreflabel="internals-xml-files">
        <title>Configuring Software with XML Files</title>

<para>
Rocks generates kickstart files for compute nodes dynamically using a
structure called the "kickstart graph".
This graph is made from graph XML files and node XML files.
In general, a node XML file contains a list of packages that should be
installed on a host and commands to configure those packages.
Graph XML files contain a description of "edges" that tie the node XML files
together.
</para>

<para>
When a host asks for its configuration file from the frontend, a process on
the frontend traverses the node XML files based on the definitions within the
graph XML files.
In addition, the graph XML files can enforce a relative order between the
node XML files.
</para>


<section id="internals-xml-files-node" xreflabel="internals-xml-files-node">
        <title>Node XML Files</title>

<para>
All software configuration commands are contained within node XML files.
Let's look at a real node XML (<constant>grub.xml</constant> from the
Base Roll):
</para>

<screen>

<package>grub</package>


<post>

<!-- take out the splashscreen -->
<file name="/tmp/grub.conf" expr="grep -v splashimage /boot/grub/grub.conf"/>
mv /tmp/grub.conf /boot/grub/grub.conf

<!-- Preserve the original grub.conf -->
cp /boot/grub/grub.conf /boot/grub/grub-orig.conf

</post>


</kickstart>
]]>
</screen>

<para>
We see that the above node XML file will install the "grub" package
(<constant>&lt;package&gt;grub&lt;/package&gt;</constant>), and in the
"post" configuration step during a kickstart installation, it will
modify the configuration file (<constant>/boot/grub/grub.conf</constant>).
</para>

<note>
<para>
During a kickstart installation, all the packages from all the node XML files
are installed first, then all the "post" sections are executed.
That is, when you write a post section, you are guaranteed that all the
software packages have been installed.
</para>
</note>

<para>
For a complete definition of the node XML file syntax, see
<xref linkend="node-xml-tags">.
</para>

<para>
For our Valgrind example, we will modify the node XML file that was already
created for us:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/src/roll/valgrind/nodes
# mv valgrind.xml valgrind-base.xml
</screen>

<note>
<para>
A node XML file naming convention in Rocks is to begin the name all the node
XML files with the name of the roll they are associated with.
For example, all node XML files in the SGE roll begin with "sge-".
</para>

<para>
Another naming convention is to add the name "client", "server" or "base" to
the name of the node XML file based on which appliance type the node XML
file will be applied to.
For example, if the node XML file is intended to configure only backend
appliances (e.g., compute nodes or tile nodes), then we'd name our node XML file
"valgrind-client.xml".
If the node XML file is intended to configure only frontend appliances, then
we'd name our node XML file "valgrind-server.xml".
And if the node XML file is for all appliance types, we'd name it
"valgrind-base.xml". 
</para>
</note>

<para>
When you edit "valgrind-base.xml", you'll see:

<para>
Every roll has node XML files and a graph XML file.
Node XML files describe what packages should be installed and how those
packages should be configured.
A graph XML file describes how all the node XML files are "connected", that is,
a graph XML file describes the "edges" between nodes.

        <title>Controlling the Order of Post Section Execution</title>

<para>
There are instances when we need to ensure that a post section in one
node XML file executes before (or after) a post section in another node XML
file.
We can accomplish this by specifying an
<constant>&lt;order&gt;</constant> tag in a graph XML
file.
To show how this is done, we'll create two new node XML files and then we'll
edit the graph XML file.
</para>

<para>
We will create two new node XML files where one file should be
applied to a frontend (named "valgrind-server.xml") and the other should be
applied to the backend appliances (named "valgrind-client.xml).
We'll add <constant>&lt;package&gt;</constant> and
<constant>&lt;post&gt;</constant> tags to both.

        <title>Attributes</title>

<para>
In Rocks, "attributes" are a way to have variables inside node and graph
XML files.
Attributes are evaluated during kickstart file creation (one of the first
actions done when a host is installed).
The following is an example of how the "hostname" attribute is used in a
post section of a node XML file:
</para>

<screen>
<![CDATA[
<post>

<!--
        set the hostname to the private name.
-->
/bin/hostname &hostname;

</post>
]]>
</screen>

<para>
In node XML files, if you want to use an attribute in a post section, you
need to encode it as an XML entity (thus the '&' and ';' characters that
bracket the "hostname" attribute).
</para>

<para>
There are four levels of attributes: global, OS, appliance and host.
Global attributes apply to all hosts in a cluster, OS attributes apply to hosts of a specific OS type (currently "linux" or "sunos"), appliance attributes
apply to hosts that have the same appliance type (e.g., compute, tile, etc.),
and host attributes apply to only one host.
You can add an attribute with one of the following commands:
<constant>rocks add attr</constant> (global),
<constant>rocks add os attr</constant> (OS),
<constant>rocks add appliance attr</constant> (appliance global),
<constant>rocks add host attr</constant> (host).
</para>

<para>
To examine which attributes are currently set for a host, execute
<constant>rocks list host attr "hostname"</constant>.
For example:

<para>
In the output above, the letters in the "SOURCE" column indicate the level
at which this host got the attribute.
'G' means the attribute is global, 'O' is an OS attribute, 'A' is an appliance
attribute, 'H' is a host attribute and 'I' in an intrinsic attribute (these
attributes cannot be removed or modified).
</para>

<para>
If a host has an attribute assigned to it, you can use it in a post section
by referring to it in its entity form ("&amp;attribute_name;").
For example, if you'd like to dynamically get the IP address of the private
network for the frontend, you'd use "&amp;Kickstart_PrivateAddress;" in a post
section.
</para>

<para>
Attributes can also be used as a "edge conditional" in graph XML files or
as a "post section conditional" in node XML files.
An edge conditional is used to conditionally traverse an edge in a graph XML
file.
The following is an excerpt from the Base Roll graph XML file:
</para>

<screen>
<![CDATA[
<edge from="client" to="x11" cond="x11"/>
]]>
</screen>

<para>
If the "x11" attribute is set to "true", then when a kickstart file is built
for a "client" host (e.g., a compute node or tile node), then the kickstart
file generation code will traverse the edge from "client" to "x11", that is, 
the "x11" node XML file will be included in the kickstart file.
Otherwise, if the "x11" attribute is set to false, then the "x11" node XML file
will not be included in the kickstart file.
</para>

<para>
Post section conditions are used to conditionally execute post sections.
The following is an excerpt from a node XML file from the SGE Roll:
</para>

<screen>
<![CDATA[
<post os="linux" cond="exec_host">

<file name="/etc/rc.d/rocksconfig.d/post-91-sge" mode="append">
SET_HOST_TYPE=" -x "
</file>

</post>
]]>
</screen>

<para>
If the attribute "exec_host" is true (and if this is a "linux" host), then the
post section will be executed, otherwise, this post section will be skipped.
