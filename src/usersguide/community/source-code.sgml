<title> Access to Rocks Source Code </title>

<para>
The source code for Rocks is available from a public read-only <ulink url="http://git-scm.com/">GIT</ulink> repository.  
As of Rocks 5.7 GIT (git) is installed on your frontend machine, for older version of Rocks (or non-Rocks platforms) you will need to install the Git package yourself.
You can download rpm packages from the EPEL Red Hat web site at <ulink url="http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/x86_64/repoview/git.html">http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/x86_64/repoview/git.html</ulink>

<para>
Git is a a distributed source control system.  
Several tutorials are provided on the GIT web site <ulink url="http://git-scm.com/documentation">http://git-scm.com/documentation</ulink>.
Fundamentally, distributed source control turns your checked out source code from a read-only copy into a repository and then grants read-write access to others based on your checked out repository.
In the context of Rocks this means individual Roll developers can independently control who has access to their code.

<para>
You can use the Git Web interface to view the source code using your browser at <ulink url="http://git.rocksclusters.org">http://git.rocksclusters.org</ulink>.
To check out the current source code you will first need to clone one of the read-only repository listed on the main web page of the Git Web interface. This operation will take several minutes (if not hours) and unlike a CVS checkout it may appear to hang, be patient.
