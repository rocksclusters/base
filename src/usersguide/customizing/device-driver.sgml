<title> Adding a Device Driver </title>

<para>
This section describes how to add a device driver to the installation
environment (<emphasis>initrd.img</emphasis>).
This enables the installation environment to use the new driver as well
as installing the device driver into the running environment (that is,
after the node has installed).
</para>

<para>
This feature is enabled by 
<ulink url="http://dup.et.redhat.com/ddiskit/">ddiskit</ulink>
which is maintained by Jon Masters at Red Hat.
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
Set up a build environment:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export
# hg clone http://fyp.rocksclusters.org/hg/rocks-rocks-&document_version;
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Go to the directory which holds the device driver code:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/rocks-&document_version;/rocks/src/roll/kernel/src/rocks-boot/enterprise/5/images/drivers
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
In this directory, you'll see some example drivers.
Let's look at the <emphasis>e1000</emphasis> driver:
</para>

<screen>
# cd e1000
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
If you want to supply a new version of the driver, you'll have to download
the e1000 source tarball and copy the *.c and *.h files from the tarball
to this directory.
Make sure all the *.c and *.h files are listed at the top of the 
<emphasis>Makefile</emphasis>:
</para>

<screen>
MODULES := e1000

SOURCES := e1000_main.c e1000_hw.c e1000_ethtool.c e1000_param.c

HEADERS := e1000.h e1000_hw.h e1000_osdep.h
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
You'll need to make sure the proper PCI ids are in the file
<emphasis>pcitable</emphasis>.
For example, to test on one of our Dell SC1425's, we added the line:
</para>

<screen>
0x8086  0x1076  "e1000" "Intel|82541GI/PI Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 05)"
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Now we'll need to specify to the device driver building code that the
e1000 driver should be built.
To do this, edit the file 
<emphasis>subdirs</emphasis>:
</para>

<screen>
# cd ..
# vi subdirs
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Change the section from:
</para>

<screen>
#
# put a list of all the driver directories that you'd like to build.
#
# for example, to build the 'e1000' driver, uncomment the line below:
#e1000
</screen>

<para>
to:
</para>

<screen>
#
# put a list of all the driver directories that you'd like to build.
#
# for example, to build the 'e1000' driver, uncomment the line below:
e1000
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Build the <emphasis>rocks-boot</emphasis> package:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/rocks-&document_version;/rocks/src/roll/kernel/src/rocks-boot
# make rpm
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
When this completes, copy the binary RPMs into a directory where the
distribution building utility (<emphasis>rocks-dist</emphasis>) will find
and include them:
</para>

<screen>
# cp /export/rocks-&document_version;/rocks/src/roll/kernel/RPMS/x86_64/rocks-boot* \
	/home/install/contrib/&document_version;/x86_64/RPMS/
</screen>

<note>
<para>
If you are building on an i386 system, change the above x86_64 references 
to i386.
</para>
</note>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Rebuild the distro:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /home/install
# rocks-dist dist
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Install the newly created <emphasis>initrd.img</emphasis> and its matching
kernel <emphasis>vmlinuz</emphasis> so PXE booted nodes will get the new
device drivers:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /home/install
# rpm -Uvh --force rocks-dist/lan/x86_64/RedHat/RPMS/rocks-boot-4*.rpm
# cp /boot/kickstart/default/initrd.img /tftpboot/pxelinux/
# cp /boot/kickstart/default/vmlinuz /tftpboot/pxelinux/
</screen>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Now PXE boot a node.
This node will load your new driver and will install this driver into the
running environment.
</para>
</listitem>

<title>
Adding a New Device Driver (That Isn't One of the Example Drivers)
</title>

<para>
If the name of your device driver you wish to add is not one of the example
device drivers (e.g., ata_piix, cciss, e1000, sk98lin, or tg3), then
you'll need to create a new directory and populate it with the appropriate
files.
</para>

<para>
For help on how to populate your new driver directory, see:
/export/rocks-&document_version;/rocks/src/roll/kernel/src/rocks-boot/enterprise/5/images/drivers/INSTALL.
</para>

<para>
The rest of the build process follows the same procedure as above starting
at step 6 where you'll have to add the name of your new driver 
to the file <emphasis>subdirs</emphasis>.
