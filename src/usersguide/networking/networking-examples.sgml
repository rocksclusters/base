<section><title>Networking Configuration Examples</title> 
<para>
In this section, we describe some common networking configurations and how to use Rocks commands to set up various networking scenarios.

<title>Adding a public IP address the second ethernet adapter on a compute node</title>
<para>
Often, owners want the second ethernet adapter to be on the public network and for the default routing to
be in the public network. Assuming that the public network is 1.2.3.0/255.255.255.0 and the default
gateway for that network is 1.2.3.1, the following set of commands define the second interface of a compute
to have address 1.2.3.25 with name mypublic.myuniversity.edu, update all required configuration files on the
frontend, update all required configuration files on the node compute-0-0 and restart the network on compute-0-0.
</para>

# rocks set host interface ip compute-0-0 iface=eth1 ip=1.2.3.25 
# rocks set host interface name compute-0-0 iface=eth1 name=mypublic.myuniversity.edu
# rocks set host interface subnet compute-0-0 eth1 public
# rocks add host route compute-0-0 1.2.3.0 eth1 netmask=255.255.255.0
# rocks sync config
# rocks sync host network compute-0-0

<section>
<title>Adding an IP network for local message passing. </title>
<para>
Often, users will want to use the second ethernet device for messaging passing. In this example, 
we illustrate creating a named subnet and then scripting the IP assignment for a rack of 32 nodes
with IP range of 192.168.1.10 ... 192.168.1.41. 
</para>
<screen>
rocks add network fast subnet=192.168.1.0 netmask=255.255.255.0
IP=10
NNODES=32
NODE=0
while [ $NODE -lt $NNODES ]; do \
	rocks set host interface ip compute-0-$NODE iface=eth1 ip=192.168.1.$IP; \
	rocks set host interface subnet compute-0-$NODE iface=eth1 subnet=fast; \
	rocks set host interface name compute-0-$NODE iface=eth1 name=compute-fast-0-$NODE; \
	rocks set host interface subnet compute-0-$NODE eth1 public
	let IP++; \
	let NODE++; \
done
rocks sync config
rocks sync host network compute
</screen>
<para>
The above will add the named subnet called "fast", assign IP addresses sequentially, name the eth1
interface on each node, rewrite the DNS configuration (sync config) and finally rewrite and restart the network
configuration on each compute appliance. This additional network configuration is persistent across 
re-installation of nodes.
