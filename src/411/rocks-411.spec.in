%description
The 411 Secure Information Service. This facility is intended to replace 
NIS which has security and scaling issues. 411 uses public-key
cryptography to securely distribute sensitive files such as group and
shadow password files. 411 uses either HTTP or HTTPS as its transport
protocol, however 411 is designed to maintain full security even with
regular HTTP. The 411 service leverages Ganglia to work at its highest
efficiency, although Ganglia is not a prerequisite for correct
operation.
